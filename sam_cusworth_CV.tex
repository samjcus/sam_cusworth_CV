\section{Profile}
Software engineer with experience developing, debugging and optimising multiple scientific
applications on high performance computing platforms.

\section{Experience}

\cventry{2018--present}{Scientific Software Engineer}{HPC optimisation team}{Met Office}{}{
I am currently a member of a team of software engineers who examine and improve the performance and
scalability of physical models run on the Met Office high performance
computing platforms.
\begin{itemize}
\item Improving the computational performance of operational weather
  model configurations.
\item Benchmarking and optimising current and future earth system
  models for use in climate projections.
\item Contributing to the development of the next generation of
  weather and climate modelling codes.
\end{itemize}
}

\cventry{2015--2018}{Scientific Software Engineer}{UM system team}{Met Office}{}{
As a member of this development team I contributed to the
continuing maintenance and modernisation of the weather and climate modelling codes.
\begin{itemize}
\item{Implemented improvements/fixes/optimisations in response to
community requests.}
\item{Performed rigorous code reviews for proposed changes.}
\item{Responsible for technical oversight of multiple sections of
  code, including the land surface science scheme.}
\item{Supported developers informally and by delivering formal training
courses.}
\end{itemize}
}

\cventry{2012--2015}{PhD}{School of Physics and
  Astronomy}{University of Manchester}{}{
During my PhD, I wrote software for large ($\sim1000^3$ element)
numerical simulations.
In particular I modified an existing MPI parallel $N$-body
simulation code to solve the equations of motion of alternative models
of gravity using a multigrid solver.

%% \section{Skills}
%% \cvitem{Problem Solving}{
%% %During my MPhys and PhD degrees I developed strong analytical and numerical skills.
%% %In particular I have a passion and a proven aptitude for mathematics, physics and computing.
%% %\newline
%% %  As an undergraduate student I sought out the most mathematically challenging courses available and actively pursued computational challenges. %this is not saying anything important
%% %  \newline 
%%   While completing my MPhys degree and PhD I identified and solved a mixture of analytic and numerical problems.
%%   On the analytic side I carried out tensor calculations in order to predict observables. 
%%   For more indepth calculations I developed software for numerical simulations on parallel architectures.
%%   As part of the software development process I have run these codes on the DiRAC national computing facility.
%%   Analysis of the simulation outputs has involved the use of advanced model fitting procedures including Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques.}
%% %these bits are not problem solving
%% \cvitem{Teamworking}{
%% While the writing of a PhD thesis is largely a solitary process, the development of the work within my thesis has been rather collaborative in nature.
%% Working in collaborations from my deptpartment in Manchester, the UK and across the world I took part in a major code comparison project.
%% %need a new sentence
%% %Working in collaboration with academics from the my department in Manchester, the UK and across the world I lead a project to compare the results of similar simulations from different research groups.
%% I also worked on other projects with my direct supervisors during my PhD, one of which lead to a journal article publication and conference talk.
%% In the development of my codebase I was fortunate enough to collaborate with postdoctorial staff and other students in my department. 
%% %\newline
%% %As well as working with colleagues at higher levels, I have also collaborated with other students on small projects and in sharing roles of responsibility.
%% }

%% \cvitem{Communication}{
%% A crucial component of my research has been the communication of important results and conclusions.
%% In this respect I have given talks to professional and public audiences.
%% As part of my doctorial studies I wrote reports for supervisors and collaborators as well as journal articles aimed at the wider research community.\newline
%% In addition I have given talks to scientific and general audiences, including astronomy societies, on a variety of topics.
%% My role as a teaching assistant has given me the chance to tutor first year undergraduates through courses on mathematics, astronomy and thermodynamics.}

%% \cvitem{Organisational}{
%% In collaboration with another postgraduate student I founded and run a series of informal lectures on various computing topics.
%% In addition I represented postgraduates in my institute by acting as an academic liaison between staff and students.
%% While carrying out my MPhys degree and PhD I also held my role as Cub Scout Leader.
%% This role involves leading the group, shaping the programme and managing my assistant leaders.}
